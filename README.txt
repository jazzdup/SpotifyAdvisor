 * Comments after Stage 3/5:
 *
 * Wow, ok the test system made that so much harder than it should have been... by swallowing everything quietly...
 * there's a valuable lesson there. In the end it wasn't actually that difficult if you read all the hints. If I'd
 * just added some logging throughout like I'd wanted to but didn't because I was lazy and debugged through the tests
 * I would have been finished much quicker.
 * People don't code like this in the real world. It's why everyone does TDD but I think it's a good, if painful
 * learning experience. I'll add a couple hints / learning points 'cos I wouldn't want to go through this pain again!
 *
 * Use reqbin or postman to get requests working with spotify API first, that's the easy bit!
 * Don't forget the -access argument at the end.
 * If the test system was a person it'd be Piers Morgan. Yuk yuk yuk I want to do bad things to the person that wrote
 * it!
 * But I've learned a lot so thanks I guess...
 * My advice would be to a) read ALL the hints, b) add some bounty questions because I'm sure people who have been
 * through this pain will help and c) add lots of logging to your code because the tests are written to deliberately
 * hide what they're doing and therefore mislead you!
 * The tricky things were to a) understand and deal with the different requests the test are making, b) make sure
 * your server waits OK for the requests to come in (don't have this problem with real spotify).
 * I actually feel really stupid because once I'd read the hints and made the server wait, I missed a tiny obvious
 * bug that I would have caught straight away if I'd setup some logging.
 * My main learning points are to read all the hints, take more breaks, add logging,  don't try to take so many
 * shortcuts and maybe don't try to finish the code after the pub, wait until the next day!
